# Fullstack Application Vue

[Demo](https://serverless.yugasun.com/)

This is a serverless fullstack application, using `Express.js` +
`Vue.js`. It aims to be the simplest possible way to build a serverless
fullstack application, including a Vue.js application on the front-end bundled
with Parcel and back-end API.

This template includes:

- **Serverless RESTful API**: Using
  [@serverless/tencent-express](https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-express)
  component, it contains a Servelress Cloud Function and a single API Gateway
  endpoint.

- **Serverless website using Vue.js**:
  [@serverless/tencent-website](https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-website),
  it deploys all static files to Cloud Object Storage.

- **Serverless CDN**:
  [@serverless/tencent-cdn](https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-cdn),
  auto set CDN and HTTPS.

> **Notice**: The frontend project is initialed by [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) which is official standard tooling for Vue.js development.

### Prepare

Before all below steps, you should install
[Serverless Framework](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless) globally:

```console
$ npm i serverless -g
```

### Download

Severless cli is very convenient, it can download templates in any github
project which should contain `serverless.yml` file.

```console
$ serverless create --template-url https://github.com/yugasun/tencent-serverless-demo/tree/master/fullstack-application-vue
```

### Bootstrap

Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` in project root:

Add the access keys of a
[Tencent CAM Role](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) with
`AdministratorAccess` in the `.env` file, like below:

```
# .env
TENCENT_SECRET_ID=xxx
TENCENT_SECRET_KEY=xxx
TENCENT_APP_ID=xxx
```

Install the NPM dependencies:

```console
$ npm run bootstrap
```

### Deploy

Deploy via the `serverless` command:

```console
$ serverless
```

Use the `--debug` flag if you'd like to learn what's happening behind the
scenes:

```console
$ serverless --debug
```

> Notice: After deploy success, please copy the postgressql private url to
> `api/.env` file.

### Development

After your first deployment, you will be able to run the frontend locally and
have it communicate to the live backend in the cloud.

```console
$ yarn start
```

### Notice

Because this project integrated cloud db connection, you should create a mysql
instance on tencent cloud, please refer to official docs:

[中文](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/38012)

After you create a mysql instance, you should create a `.env` file in `api`
folder, and set all required parameters like `.env.example`.
